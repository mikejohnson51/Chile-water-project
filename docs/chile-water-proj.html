<h5>Chile is a South American country with a variety of climates, a moderately sized, predominantly urban population, and a growing economy. Chile spans ~40° of latitude leading to various climates: dry deserts in the north, a Mediterranean climate in the center and a wet, humid climate in the south (Figure 1) (1). Chile is ~750,000 km2, with 21% of land dedicated to agriculture (2, 3). Precipitation varies from the North to the South (Figure 2) (1, 2). The rainy season is from June to September. Chile has a population of ~17 million and 87% of the population lives in central Chile around the cities of Santiago and Valparaiso. The northern and southern regions are rural and scarcely populated (2). Over the last 30 years Chile’s GDP has risen 6% annually (3). Chile’s economy is based on foreign trade and exports of its mining and agricultural resources (2, 3). Water demands are expected to increase as Chile’s economy continues to grow around water intensive industries, while water supply is expected to decrease.</h5>

<h5>Most of Chile’s water supply is comprised of surface waters (Figure 3) (1, 4). Chile’s surface water resources are comprised of rivers, lakes, and reservoir storage (4). Annual precipitation, River runoff, and water losses due to evaporation vary with latitude (Figure 4), consequently, so does water availability (Figure 5) (3, 4). The northern rivers are fed by snow melt, central rivers are fed by snow melt and rain, and southern rivers are fed by rain (Figure 5) (4, 5). Northern groundwater aquifers are comprised of fossil water and experience minimal recharge from surface waters (3).</h5>

<h5>In Chile, the primary water demands are for energy and agriculture, followed by city and environmental demands (Figure 6). Water use in Chile differs regionally; the mining and industrial sectors are concentrated in the north, while large scale agricultural is in central Chile (Figure 7) (1, 7). Irrigation makes up ~73% of water consumption in Chile (Figure 6). Municipal water demands are greatest near the capital, Santiago (Figure 8) (3). Decreased water quality from pollution and decreased stream flows from upstream dams have put stress on river and groundwater ecosystems (4, 9).</h5>

<h5>Chile has two key opportunities to combat its water challenges: increase water-use efficiency in agriculture and municipalities and develop cooperation among water users. Implementing microirrigation systems (Figure 12-13) and conservational agriculture practices (Figure 14) could increase agricultural water efficiency (6-8, 13). Chile can introduce incentives for reductions in water use, raise awareness on water issues, and create efficiency standards for buildings (3, 6). Chile can institute penalties on water overages and nonessential water consumption, and invest in upgrading piping infrastructure (6). Establishing integrated water management among water users can improve water allocation and reduce pollution (3, 4, 6).</h5>

<h5>Chile faces tradeoffs if it is to implement changes to agricultural, residential, and water management practices discussed above. Replacing surface irrigation with micro irrigation would decrease agricultural water requirements and evaporative losses, however micro irrigation has a high initial cost and the departure from surface irrigation can decrease deep percolation into groundwater aquifers (Figure 15) (6, 13). Implementing incentives and penalties will reduce water demands and lessen water stress on the environment, yet enacting these programs requires governmental oversite and is politically and socially unpopular (Figure 16) (6, 13, 14). Deteriorated pipes, poor infrastructure, and inaccuracies in water monitoring systems account for 22 percent of Chile’s avoidable water losses, however upgrading these systems requires substantial monetary and human capital investments (6, 15). Creating solidarity among administrative regions will cultivate sustainable water resource management solutions but would require cooperation between the Chilean government and the water users (3, 6).</h5>
